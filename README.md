# ChemBDDB
A software assisted database infrastructure for the exploration of chemical and material space. 

This software is built to enable proper bookkeeping of chemical data generated through ChemML(Machine Learning Module) and 
ChemHTPS(High Throughput Screening Module). The main agenda of ChemBDDB is to simplify the use of database technology for 
non-expert users in the Chemistry community. It features an automated setup database facility, a customizable data model
template and tools that can be used to store, manipulate and access the database. 

## Getting Started
These steps will get you to run a copy of the project on the local machine for deployment and testing purposes.
